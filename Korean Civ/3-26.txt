-Japan’s Reactions
    - None of the “comfort women” were forcibly recruited, and not forced to have sex
    - On August 4th, 1993, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono
    -   The Government of Japan has been conducting an investigation on the
        issue of wartime “comfort women” since December 1991. I wish to
        announce the findings as a result of that investigation. As a result of the
        investigation which indicates that comfort stations were operated in
        extensive areas for long periods, it is apparent that there existed a great
        number of comfort women. Comfort stations were operated in response
        to the request of the military authorities of the day. The Japanese
        military was, directly or indirectly, involved in the establishment and
        management of the comfort stations and the transfer of comfort
        women. The recruitment of the comfort women was conducted mainly
        by private recruiters who acted in response to the request of the
        military. The Government investigation has revealed that in many cases
        they were recruited against their own will, through coaxing, coercion,
        etc., and that, at times, administrative/military personnel directly took
        part in the recruitments. They lived in misery at comfort stations under a
        coercive atmosphere.”
    - the first Japanese official recognition
    - Abe administration
    - Japanese right wing
    - Matsumoto Masayoshi
- comfort women issues
    - some of the comfort women were kidnapped; some volunteered;
    - many of these young women were lured with the promises of job at factories or restaurants
    - Abe administration denied this
    - women lured with good jobs
    - 1945 japanese surrender, but evidence that japanese soldiers killed women
    - administration still denies this
    - response of comfort women issue: japanese say it's finished
    - "issue was already finished"
- Rhee Syngman
    - first South Korean president, no diplomatic treaty w/ japan
    - 1965, park chung hee treaty with japanese govt
        - sexual issues were "done."
        - how do you interpret this treaty?
    - "the third clause of the article 2", Korea Japan treaty in 1965
        -   “no claims shall be made with respect to the measures relating to the
            property, rights, and interests of either High Contracting Party and its
            people which were brought under the control of the other High
            Contracting Party on the date of the signing of the present Agreement,
            or to all the claims of either High Contracting Party and its people
            arising from the causes which occurred prior to that date”
        - japanese govt gave $800 million to the Korean govt, half were loans
        - with this treaty, korean govt "renounced all rights" to any conversation
        - but according to korean govt, doesnt say south korea shouldnt have any claims or reparations regarding damagaes to colonization (which is the truth)
- neither sides talked about the sexual slavery issue
    - 1993 japanese govt had acknowledged it for the first time
    Japan: South Korean government renounced all rights to request reparation and compensation
    - South Korea:
        - The treaty doesn’t say that South Korea should not request any more compensations regarding the damages due to the colonization
        - neither side talked about sexual slave issues at all
        - at least, personal right for “comfort women” to demand compensation is still valid
    - 2015 Korea-Japan Agreement
        - Park Geun Hye administration: if Japan donates about 10 million dollars, then Korean government ends this comfort women issue for good.
        - This is a final and irreversible resolution
    - Mun Jae In Administration
        - 2015 agreement cannot be a true and final resolution
        - Nonetheless, Korean government cannot deny that that agreement
        was an official resolution
        - stalemate
