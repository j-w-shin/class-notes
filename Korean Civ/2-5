    - king sejong completed it in 1443
        - took approximately 10 years
    - promulated in 1446
    - in the end, confucian scholars used it, too; useful for learning classical chinese, did not write pronunciation of the words and just had to memorize everything
    - communication with commoners and women; also very useful
    - classical chinese used when higher ranks communicated with each other
    - who exactly created hangul? why?
        - some scholars argue that hangul was created not for commoners; sejong created it to spread buddhist faith. sejong actually a devout buddhist to make buddhism more popular

            - worin chongang chcigok, yongbi ochonka
                - second praised choson royal family
            - sejong actually became devout buddhist in his later years, but hangul was created in earlier years; still a significant argument

        - sanskrit is totally different from hangul, according to professor
        - perhaps some inspirations from sanskrit, but there is no evidence about this
    - who? Sinmi?
        - he knew sanskrit better than sejong... prof thinks it's a weak argument
            - also sanskrit perhaps had influence on japanese language? 
        - did sejong create it alone?
            - by the way sejong died 4 years after promulgation

- relationship between kingship and bureaucracy
    - how to promote meritocracy in the context of a hereditary monarchy/kingship
        - kings wanted to have strong royal power so they naturally tend to appoint those close to him to very important positions, so king can maintain his power
        - kings thus could do what they wanted to
        - those becoming officials in his way had trouble
    - confucian scholar tried to create body to check arbitrary use of the royal poewr, and promote meritocracy
    - officials preferred a prime minister centered bureaucracy
        - chong tojon had come up with this; king did not actually have power
    - first 200 years of choson, king and officials struggle
    - yonsangun was royal power supremacist
        - did not respect shrine of confucius, he was an official, not a king

    - but when you take the exams you need you write all your ancestors
    - if any of them are in government currently, most likely you get a job
    - if no ancestry, most likely no job or low rank official
- yangban exams were really important
    - had to pass at least sokwa to retain their minimum privileges
    - according to edward wagner, more than 40% of about 14600 successful candidates came only from 21 clans -- that is, there was a system of power from generation to generation
        - always around power
        - check the power of the king
        - factions
- why confucian officials/scholars criticize buddhism in early choson?
