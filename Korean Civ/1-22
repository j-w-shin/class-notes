Ko Choson, Three Kingdoms

- Ko Choson beginning of korean state
- located in yao shi in yaodong (NW of NK today)
- another theory, Ko Choson was in Pyongyang
- others say they moved to Pyongyang
- Some texts say Ko Choson founded 2333 BCE
- Samguk Yusa says 2308 BCE, but they were written in Koryo (918-1392)
- Bronze Age 10th century BCE, violin-shaped daggers in yao shi yao dong area
- Ko Choson mustve been founded around this time
- Zanguoce, compiled ~3rd century BCE, text says Ko Choson located east of Yan, ruler called himself king
- Guanzi book, 4th BCE, maybe in Qi state of china (1046-221 BCE)
- centralized political system
- Siji, Weilue, Ko Choson invaded by chinese (yan)
- Qin unified china (221-206 BCE), then Han (202-9BCE, 25-220 CE)
- Wiman of Yan state went to Ko Choson with ~1000 followers, became king himself
- huge profit through transit trade w/ China and southern part of korea 
- not much is known about Wiman Choson
- Another Choson, the Kija Choson
- Shangshu text compiled, Kija was royal member of Yin dynasty, one of oldest dynasties (~1500 BCE) controlling part of china
- Kija was appointed
- No materials or relics related to Yin were found... did not exist!!
- Kija Choson mustve been a product of imagination of Chinese people ...
- Shangshu is a Confucian classic text
- Ko Choson society
    - Eight laws:
    - if you kill, you are sentenced to death.
    - if steal, slave. or 500,000 coins compensation (how much? dunno)
    - if injure, compensate
    - agricultural, and hierarchal.
    - but Ko Choson not sure if care about human ethics... just human labor and grains
    - King of Ko Choson probably called Tan'gun, but didnt have absolute power
    - Ko Choson collapsed when Han unified China again, and chinese commanderies attacked Ko Choson in 108 BCE
    - Nangnang established, destroyed 32 BC by Kokuro
    - Tan'gun myth -- read about it in the readings
- Tan'gun Myth - Samguk yusa books doesnt have this myth
- Tan'gun reltaed to mountain god worship in the norther part of KP
- object of the local worship around Pyongyang region
- Tan'gun said to be the father of the people
- During colonial times, it was dismissed as nonsensical.. as an effort to facilitate the Japanese colonial rule over Korea
- Tan'gun myth ignored, said started in Wiman Choson, China's colony, and now Japan's colony
- After Ko Choson, a lot of city states with Iron Age:
- After Ko Choson, Puyo, Koguryo, Tongye, Okcho, and Samhan. Samhan: Paekche, Silla, and Kaya
- Koguryo became one of "The Three Kingdoms"
    - Origin myth: Chumong, founder of Koguryo
    - Stated in many materials: Kwanggaet'o Inscription (5th century), Weishu, Samguk Sagi (hereafter SS), Samguk Yusa (hereafter SY)
    - Story: heavenly god's son came to earth, met woman. man went back to heaven alone. she was kicked out of her place since without permission. accepted into Buyo, another city state. sunlight began to start chasing her. she got pregnant and gave birth to egg. Inside, Chumong, strong, good looking guy
    - Buyo King's Prince became jealous of Chumong, tried to kill him. Chumong and 10k followers left and built his own kingdom.
    - King Sosurim cretaed T'aehak, a school, and issued laws (371-394)
    - Then, King Kwanggaet'o under rule (name means "expanding land greatly")
    - During his son's reign, Koguryo reached peak size
    - Kwanggaet'o almost forgotton after Koguryo, one of the only two Korean "Great" kings (monarchs) along with King Sejong
    - Almost never mentioned later in Korean classical texts
- Paekche (18 BCE - 660 CE)
    - founded by one of sons of Chumong, named Onjo (18 BCE - 28 CE)
    - King Kunch'ogo (346-375) conquered western, southern KP
    - pushed northern border above han river
    - easy to get to china and japan
    - mostly fighting with Koguryo and other states
    - After him, King Mu (600-641)
    - Then, King Ulja, but collapse came.
    - Very intricate relics from this time period
    - also transmitted buddhism to japan: scriptures, sculptures to japan
    - worked to build religious philosophers towards japan
    - in 2000, Akihihto said: recorded in Chronicles of Japan said mother of Emperor Kammu was in line of King Muryong.
- Silla (57 BCE - 935 CE)
    - unified the three kingdoms in 676
    - King Pophung, new laws (r. 514-540)
    - successor, King Chinhung (r. 540-576)
    - betrayed Paekche and expanded territory so Paekche became shrunk SW of KP peninsula
    - Paekche, Koguryo allied to attack Silla, with Japan help
    - Dan dynasty asked by Silla for help, reunification war began
    - Koguryo was a buffer state of China to help develop
    - Koguryo was attacked by Chinese dynasties quiet a lot
    - Sui (581-619) attacked Koguryo four times, 300,000 soldiers attacked by Wendi, 281-604, almost 250k killed
    - Then son, Yangdi, 604-617, several million attacked, failed again.
    - The 2nd attempt, several hundred thousand attacked Pyongyang. "Sweeping Victory at Salsu"
        - That was Koguryo's strategy: attacked 1KM line straight through heart of Korea, but they were surrounded and had to retreat
        - Only 2700 survived of 300,000
        - "Salsu Taech'op", the name of the river they made dam. Ulchi Mundok, the name of the Koguryo general
        - Attacked two more times but they failed
    - Tang dynasty tried (618-907), but failed. Yaizong (r. 626-549): 1st attempt. Terrible injury that made him die.
        - Then, Gaozong (r. 649.683): 2nd, 3rd attempts.
- Kaya
    - Mimana Nihon-fu, Kaya area name.
    - During three kingdoms period, Kaya existed between Paekche and Silla.
    - Group of 12 small kingdoms
    - Kaya not recorded in Samguk Sagi, compiled by Kim Pusik (1075-1151), descendant of Silla. Ignored existence of Kaya
    - Plenty of Iron in Kaya. Developed a great trade system, but conquered by Silla in late 6th century
    - late 20th century, Japanese scholars said  Yamato regime (250-710) colonized the area from late 4th century to 6th century.
    - Japanese colony established "Mimana Nihon-fu"
    - Japan apparently colonized parts of Korea at this time
    - Scholars presented some evidence, "Nihon shoki" compiled ~680-720
    - Credibility of Nihon shoki about early history has shaky credibility, all names completely wrong
    - Term "Nihon" not used even in Japan until 7th century, date of when it was compiled 
    - Kwanggaet'o inscription became important -- discovered again in late 19th century
        - japanese first cited this to prove existence of Mimana Nihon-fu
- P25 of Sources 1: "Paekchan and Silla had long been our Koguryo subject peoples and as such had brought tribute to our court. But the Wa ... and subjected its people"
        - japanese translated it as "The Wa (a Japanese people and state in Kushu) had, since the sinmyo year (391), come accross the sea, defeated Paekche, Kaya, and Silla, and subjected their people."
        - but Kwanggaet'o inscription cant confirm anything
        - "Wa" was not strong enough
        - no remains found
- Keyhole-shaped tombs in Japan: 3rd century Japan 
    - In Korea, similar keyhole-shaped tombs also were found
    - Korean keyhole tombs were much later created, making Japanese scholars excited
    - Mimana Nihon-fu history seemed to maybe make sence in 19th century
    - in 1996, in Paekche Silla area, a keyhole-shape original tomb was found .. at least century earlier than Japanese tomb
    - twist and shock to Japanese scholars
    - In 2010, Japanese and Japanese scholars agreed not to talk about these keyhole tombs and Mimana Nihon
    - Japanese text books for high school students talk about Mimana Nihon
- Another controversy among chinese scholars
    - Chinese North East Project
    - research project from 2002-2007
    - Involved Ko Choson, Koguryo, and Parhae
    - argued that Koguryo, Ko Choson, and Parhae is actually part of chinese history
    - many said this project is more politically oriented then academic in nature
    - to provide rationale for what chinese government will do if it had to advance to North Korea
    - as, if Kim Jong Un were to be killed
    - one of big issues surrounding ancient Korea
