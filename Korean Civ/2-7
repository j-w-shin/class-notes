        - petition against government
            - but town commoners petitioned against his petition, saying he was commoner, not yangban
        - clan members wrote to help choe
        - 16 years after first petition, choe was finally recognized as yangban
        - his success of ancestor names helped him
    - around the same time, pawk pongsu in cholla province
        - fail exam for 9 generaitons, family was poor
        - took civil service exam for 20 years, finally passed sokwa at 43
        - threw a party in his village
        - got lucky, and got govt position, although low, but at 51 his son also passed civil service exam
        - were they recognized socially as yangban in their society? don't know, but his name was not listed in yangban
            - he was not recognized by other yangban as being a yangban
            - told his children to be a gentleman, live life with dignity like yangban
        - thus, tax exemption
    - but not all yangban were lucky; some became subject to taxation just like commoners
        - first case was due to family records, chokpo
    - social connections with other yangban members
    - yu taechi (1831-1884) enightment thinker from the secondary class
        - his ancestor passed civil service exam in the mid 18th century, but remained as the secondary class
    - yangban was both legal status, and also social status
        - just because legally a yangban doesnt mean you have social prestige
        - your family needs prestige
        - also needs to be confirmed and reconfirmed through relationships with other yangban family members
    - yangban is a really privleged class, that's why everyone wants to become yangban
    - but we as koreans use yangban term still
        - refers more to 'male adult', no real class distinction there anymore
        - do not use this term to a senior, because it has some derogatory implications
