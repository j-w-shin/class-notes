Choson 2, 2-7
- Japanese invasions
    - japan invated two times, first in the year of imjin waeran (japanese disturbance of injin the dragon year)
    - second, chongyu chaeran (japanese disturbance of chongyu the rooster year)
    - total, 1592/4/14 to 1598/11/19
    - in japan, it's called bunroku keicho no eki, chinese wanli chaoxian zhi yi
- toyotomi hideyoshi, unified japan
    - granted land gifts to generals, but it was too small -- turned to korea
    - on april 13, 1592 with about 200,000 soldiers
    - defeated choson navy easily, and landed in southeast - busan
    - divided into three armies: jeongju, gwangju, ulsan areas
    - no fierce resistance from choson
    - northern border especially strong, south not very well prepared -- all wars came to north
    - choson had no standing army
    - peaceful time for 200 years with no big wars to other countries, so they mobilize commoners
        - but they were not trained well, japanese warriors seasoned well
        - choson farmer soldiers probably have never seen or heard gunshots before, only arrows
    - japanese army goes quickly to choson capital, government scared of course - 8,000 sent, including general Shinni
        - he was too confident and looked down on japanese army, had some success but later failed and committed suicide
    - choson full panic mode
    - king escaped at night from the capital, on april 30th
    - seoul became very chaotic, slaves used opportunity to burn government office where slave documents existed
    - japanese army captured capital in just 20 days
        - (european imported weapons, especially portuguese)
    - seoul, busan distance is 250ish miles, so 20 days to capture all of this land is crazy -- 12 miles a day
    - goal of japanese army was to capture choson king
        - in japan, capturing king meant the war ended
    - choson government was messy at the time; busy trying to get more power and didnt care about outside
    - there was intelligence that japanese jurchen would attack choson, so they got ready just a little
        - but they overestimated defense ability, and underestimated jurchen forces, especially guns
- yongsan
    - strategically important
    - next to han river, easy to get in and out of the country, close to middle of capital city
    - during colonial times, japanese headquarters was there
        - also us army had their HQ there, still under us control
    - jurchen move to yongsan and go north to conquer korea and capture king
    - captured pyongyang on june 14, 1592
    - king was in Uiju, trying to go to china; pathetic king
    - kwanghaegun (r. 1608-1623), crown prince, later became king
    - some of king's princesses were captured, but focused on capturing king
- uibyong (riteous armies)
    - local confucian scholars became leaders, mobilized soldiers (literatis, commoners, some slaves join this 'guerilla' army to attack from behind)
    - as big as 1/4 of the korean regular army, worked with them
    - confucian scholars accused buddhist monks of being unloyal, but they violated Buddhist precept
    - monk's militia
        - ad-hoc fortress to defend capital area
        - hyujong (1520-1604), one of first leaders, gathering 5000 monks
        - yujong (1544-1610), another leader
            - received great trust from king sunjo, militia had been guards to the king
            - had a lot of trust from the government
            - later became japanese envoy to negotiate and get kidnapped soldiers
        - performed buddhist rituals for the dead
- yi sunsin (1545-1598)
    - turned the tide of the war
    - at first he was in charge of southwest area (jeollado)
    - yi sunsin's navy controlled the sea
    - japanese first wanted to send navy around yellow sea (SW) and through han river and through to capital
    - but yi sunsin blocked this move at the south, big naval battle
    - hansando taechop (sweeping victory near hansando island)
        - employed famous 'hagik chin' (crane's wing) formation
        - destroyed 60 of 70 japanese naval ships, crucial to choson government
        - one of three greatest victories in korea (know the other two)
    - japan was thus forced to change their plan
        - japan avoided naval battle as much as possible and focused on pyongsangdo
    - thus japanese could not go forward north because no military supplies
        - began to suffer, especially with cold
    - sunsin was also a great admiral, always planned excellent tactics
    - also better cannons, and very sturdy ships
