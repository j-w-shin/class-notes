        - idea of "national self-determination"
        - "national aspirations must be respected; people may now be dominated and governed only by their own consent"
        - koreans liked this idea
    - king gojong died in 1919

    - 33 national representatives at pagoda park or tapgol park
        - right before meeting, changed plan to draft at a restaurant
        - reason: if done at a park, violence may occur
        - told owner of restaurant to call japanese police to tell them they're having a meeting about korean independence
        - arrested; turned themselves in
    - many people gathered at the park
    - students read the declaration of independence at the park
    - from the next day, the movement spread to other cities of Korea
        - arrests made by japanese police, but movement quick to spread
        - by march 2nd, almost the entirety of the northern half of KP
        - hundreds of protets by april
        - non-violence campaign, but japanese killed protesters
        - movements became violent in self defense
    - according to records in 1920 by koreans: 2 million participated, 7509 killed, 15850 injured, 45306 arrested
    - according to japan, 1 million participated, 533 killed, 12000 arrested

- influences
    - japanese later changed ruling style from the coverage
    - newer "cultural rule"

    - but japanese rule tightened in other ways
        - 3x number of police
        - korean people divided by carrot-and-stick approaches
    - first public demonstration of the solidarity of the Korean people against the japanese colonial rule

        - japanese say about 1000 members in 1923
- christianity and nationalist movements
    - (all protestants, not catholics)
    - protestants are rather politically conservative
    - claim that protestantism led the march first movement
    - pro military dictatorship, pro big company, pro japanese, pro american
    - not nationalists
    - identify themselves as christians, rather than koreans
    - not all christians are this way, but small christians contributed to deverlopment of human rights and democratization movements
    - among 33 "national representatives", 16 were protestants, 15 were cheongdogyo people, 2 buddhists
        - many christians were involved in march first movement
        - because of march first movement, 7835 prosecuted, 1719 were protestants
        - 22% of prosecuted were christians
        - christians were only 1% of korean population, so this was a lot
        - also jap colonial govt did not like christianity because it was always connected to western imperial powers
        - western missionaries were considered bad, almost spies of westerners
        - japanese burned christian churches and killed many
        - missinoaries saw what japanese did to koreans people, reported march first movement to famous newspapers
        - overwhelming evidence that korean christians used to say christianity led the march first movement
    - cheam-ri, church destroyed by japanese, killed by 30
- missionaries
    - arthur j brown: "Japanese administration is far better than Korea would otherwise have had and far better than Korea had under its own rule."
    - western missionaries aruged for separation of religion and politics
    - before march first movement, missionaries told koreans not to participate
    - but as japanese brutally crushed march first movement, missionaries took sides with koreans
    - franch w. schofield (1889-1970) let the world know about march first movement
    - some missionaries told japanese to chance colonial policy
        - missionary activities didnt protect all korean people
        - rather, protect innocent korean protestants
    - korean leaders knew the missionaries were to serve personal salvaiton, not nationalistic interests
    - missionaries were thus in many ways not much different from japanese collaborators
    - western missionaries calmed down korean people
    - dr. o.r. avison, dr. samuel moffet
        - received honors from japanese government
- protestant leaders
    - cheondogyo prepared most of the funds
    - korean christian leaders received money from cheondogyo
    - christian leaders participated in march first mostly because they received money from cheondogyo
        - used half money for living expenses of their families
    - shows korean christianity at the time did not support nationalist movement at all
        - not that christians did not have money; built a lot of private schools
        - but some christian national representatives didnt have money for march first movement
        - korean national christian representatives knew they would be sent to prison, so what would happen to their families?
    - kil seonju, a pastor
        - famous, one of the first seven Korean pastors ordained in 1907
        - many argue Kil Seonju signed the declaration of indep, and thus he was himself a nationalist
        - but we have his prior records ... seonju stated he would not agree on independence movement
        - seonju said he had been deceived by yi seonghun
        - claimed he never seen or heard about the declarations
        - march first, his name was already publicized on declaration, then shocked
        - to prove his innocence he turned them in
        - He believed that it was a petition to the Japanese government, not the declaration of independence
        - said he would never participate in this movement at all in the future
        - some say this was a court tactic..
        - but kil seongju didnt really do anything for the march first movement
- protestant participants
    - Came from a few cities
    - About 10 % of the Christian population of those cities
    - They did not represent Korean Christianity
    - regarded as aberrants at the time, a minority
- what did they actually do? (korean christians at the time)
    - separation of religion and politics
    - praying for eternal life in heaven
    - religious escapism
    - when fellow korean people were arrested, tortured, raped, killed...
    - religious comfort in difficult time
    - claimed christianity led march first movement, is nonsense
    - another twist: in 1930s, as japan was in full war preparation move
        - supported japanese government, donating, holding a prayer meeting
        - pray for soldiers, and korean students encouraged to join japanese army
        - bells donated to the japanese govt
        - violated their own principle for the japanese govt
    - christianity was thus at the time more of an interest group
        - not really a religious group
        - after liberation, they've been doing the same hting again, and again
    - majority of korean christians enjoyed cultural, social privileges from military dictatorship governments in 1960s-1980s
    - attacked the democratic govt in 2000s for not granting any priveleges to the korean church
