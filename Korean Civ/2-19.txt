- Buddhism and Confucianism in Choson
- Sokguram Grotto (8th century) buddhist temple
- Common perception of korean buddhism
    - korean buddhism in choson, the last dynasty of korea, was in decline because of harsh persecution by the confucian ruling class
    - religion for marginalized people
    - significantly declined in quantity, quality
    - Takashi Toru
        - book: Richo Bukkyo
        - Argued that Choson buddhism was poor imitation of chinese buddhism, no innovation
        - popular thought among scholars
    - "Confucians ransaked temples and harassed monastics."
    - "On the whole Korean buddhists found themselves on the bottom rung of the social ladder w/ minimal financial, educational, social and political resources"
    - colonialist view / japanese view not necessarily wrong
- Choson government
    - buddhists persecuted by confucian ruling classes
    - ban against buddhist clerics from entering the capital
        - sejong announced this ban for first time, 1430
        - after that, 13 more times issued
    - imposition of various labor requirements on buddhist community
- Gyeongguk Daejeon
    - the first law book of choson, Grand Code for State Administration, 1471
    - did not have buddhist bans in this just yet
- Daejeon Husongnok, "Later Supplement to the Grand Code"
    - finally had buddhihst ban, 1543, in paper
- buddhist monks were seen in capital because the ban law wasn't strongly enforced
- royal buddhist policy
    - king myongjong
        - when king, he was super young
    - mother Queen Dowager Munjeong, governed state as a woman, devout buddhist
        - adopted pro-buddhist policy
        - national defense, appointed a buddhist monk
    - hyujong, buddhist monk who got a lot of respect from the government 
        - dispatched in japan as envoy
    - king sonjo
        - son, king kwanghae, very close to a monk who stayed in capital palace for a while
    - yujong, another buddhist monk, who could talk w/ king
    - after ban was issued, was relatively strictly enforced at first, but later it was not as strict anymore. govt officials get mad, enforce laws, then weaken, etc. cycle
- monk services
    - military service
        - buddhist monks suffered from military service
        - most serious burden
        - choson government during japanese invasions (1592-1598) witnessed valor of buddhists
            - efficacy of buddhist monks for military purposes
            - 20 years after japanese invasions, govt mobilizes buddhist monks to build fortress in namhansan (1624), south of capital
            - wore military clothes, for capital defense
        - expanded after manchurian invasions (1636-1637)
            - built another fortress norht of seoul, by buddhist monks
            - pukhansan (1711)
    - new policy, 700 buddhist monks must be replaced 6 times a year 
    - government did not pay anything for military services
    - monks recruited from all over country, and their affiliated temples had to pay expenses
        - traveling, training services
    - finally in 1755, 1785, govt reduced the financial burden of the buddhist community
    - still at the time, more important fortresses on coastal lines, mobilized buddhist monks to repair and station the fortresses
    - imposition of military and other labor services on the buddhist community did not come from ideological intentions
    - immense warfare expenses
    - government experiences huge financial difficulty and need for public construction was high
    - choson govt felt it was not right to mobilize commoners who barely made a living, doing this stuff
        - this would increase grudge of commoners to government and jeopardize the safety of govt
        - thus turned to buddhists
    - however buddhism was included in the choson system
        - buddhist monks replaced commoners in choson taxation system
        - choson govt realized they needed to keep buddhist monks, should not be eradicated from society of choson
        - thus, later they supported money to buddhists to rebuilt temples, donated money to destroyed temples
- social (and legal) status of buddhist monks
    - some say they belong to lowest class of choson society
    - likened to slaves
    - technically, slaves are not required to pay taxes and do labor
    - there is no evidence that buddhist monks belong to lowest class of choson society
        - perhaps takashi toru was the first to make this argument
    - some buddhist monks came from commoner class, or confucian literati class, or slave class
    - choson govt recorded the household record from 1675
        - diverse social classes and social rankings
        - yangsung (commoner monks)
        - sano (temple servants)
        - songgyungwanno (servants in confucian academy)
        - other rankings
    - commoner-monks
        - more than half of buddhist monk population
    - servants
    - duty- exempted monks
    - leaders of the buddhist order
    - commoner-monks did all labor and military requirements that the court imposed on the buddhist community.
- confucian literati and buddhism
    - many confucian intellectuals held a favorable attitude toward buddhism
- yi i
    - suppsoedly he was buddhist when he was younger
        - shaved head, clothes
        - raised questions about enshrinement of yi i
    - theory of cheng-zhu philosophy became one of the main-stream interpretations 
    - enshrinement of yi i
        - 1635-1682
        - controversy
        - yi i did not deserve the honor of enshrinement
        - it is natural for a confucian student to fall for buddhism
- financial support for buddhism
    - in the record of the temple kumsan: great donors
        - kim su-hang, chief councilor
        - nam kuman, left councilor
    - in several extant temple records, number of central and local officials were recorded as major donors for diverse buddhist projects
- ideological support for buddhism
    - che chegong: way of buddhism and that of confucianism are in concert. Why are we worried that buddhism is a heterodoxy?
    - kim chosun
        - a high ranking official as well as patriarch of the andong kim consort clan
        - "the buddhist way of training mind is not different from the confucian way"
    - kim chwa-gun
    - choui uisun
    - kim chong-hui
        - sent as exile to cheju island
    - paekpa kungson
        - ki chongjin
        - a record of paekpa's society for son and Kyo
    - debate with kim chong-hui about theories
- interaction between buddhist monks and confucian literati 
- confucianization of buddhism
    - muyong suyon
        - asserted that if you are loyal to the king, and filial piety to parents, you will be reborn in the highest place in pure land, with a golden body
        - pure land = awakening
    - yongdam chogwan
        - emphasized filial piety
        - without it, there is no way that you can achieve buddist way
    - choui uisun
        - "bromance monk"
        - letter to confucian literati friend, said highest spiritual level of buddhism can be achieved through confucian ideals
        - from the four basi principles in confucian texts:
            - regulate the family, governing people, helping the state and pacifying the world
    - seems like buddhist monks made a compromise in choson
    - confucianization of buddhism indicated difficult situation of buddhism at the time as a survival tactic
        - true, but this is also one way to reach out to more people
        - reach out to confucian literati who have economic, political power in choson
        - also buddhism situation was not as bad as japanese scholars argue
    - buddhism existed in choson society as a viable religious, cultural force
        - paekpa kungson
    - during the reign of king honjong
    - paekkok chonung
    - kanpyesokyoso
        - petition against abolishing the teachings of buddhism
- throughout choson, there were active interactions between buddhist monks and confucian literati
    - buddhism was not persecuted by ruling class of choson
    - because we have a lot of confucian literati who were family members, supported buddhism financially and idology
    - (regardless of government positions)
