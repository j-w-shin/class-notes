Koryo 1
- Two important texts: Koryosa (compiled 1392-1451), Koryosa Choryo (compiled 1452)
- Wang Kon unified later three kingdoms, established Koryo in 918, and Silla 935, and Paekche army defeated (later Paekche army, the Parhae) in 926; most moved down to South to Koryo
    - Khitans, Jurchens controlled Manchuria
    - Koryo, 34 kings
- Koryo ruled peninsula for almost 500 years until 1392, there were 34 kings
- Many say Koryo was successor of kuguryo, during reign of King Changsu (412-491)
    - why was this new land called Koryo? ... just scholar convenience
    - changed during reign of King Changsu, son of great king Kwanggaetto, who greatly expanded lands
    - used Confucianism to legitimize their loyal power
    - Wang Kon received "mandate of heaven" to rule the country
        - why new name for dynasty? because many political rivals
        - also silla had been there for ~1000 years
        - just as many pro-silla people as anti-silla people
        - Koguryo, Silla had just equal amt of history - Silla vs Kogryo in Koryo
        - Kim Yu Si (samguk sagi) actually silla guy
        - Wang Kon used Silla to strengthen royal power, also didnt attack Silla directly
        - just waited until Silla gave in
        - Wang Kon also advised descendants to keep Silla Buddhist ideas
        - Wang Kon used Buddhism, Confucianism to strengthen power
        - also he used marriage to achieve power
        - 25 sons from 29 wives, 34 children
        - caused inheritance issues: who is the next king of Koryo?
        - Hyejong (943-945) was the first, but his mother's power wasnt that great in comparison to Wang Kong's other wives
        - there were a lot of assassination attempts, some argue he was actually assassinated
        - Third son, Chongjong (945-949) became king, purged all his political rivals
            - ~300 people died in just 4 years
            - some argue he was also assassinated
- Kwangjong (949-975), fourth brother of Wang Kon, became next king
    - any rejection to his policies, he just removed them from office
    - strengthening the royal power
    - civil service exams (kwango) in 958
        - Tokso sampum kwa in Silla -- failed because Jinggol family members
            - also limited to only low ranking officials
        - kwango played decisive role in finding centralized power
        - abolished in 1894, Choson (1392-1910)
    - released slaves (who used to be commoners but became slaves because political or economic reasons)
        - not necessarily humane action -- to weaken his political rivals
    - supported Buddhism financially and politically -- useful to strengthen royal power
- sixth king, Songjong (981-997)
    - Confucian aristocratic political system was established
    - almost opposite to what Kwangjong had done
    - strengthened govt official's power instead of kings power
        - why? songjong was ardent follower of confucianism so probably why
        - also only exception in that he hated buddhism
    - Choe Sung ro (927-989) a renowned confucian scholar, appointed
        - old silla rank 6, lived in Kaesong area, no ties with countryside
        - submitted policy proposal of 28 items
            - songjong accepted most proposals; 22 of 28
            - later foundation for Koryo to develop as centralized dynasty
        - Confucian Kingly Way
            - king should treat govt officials very well; let them do their job
        - stop King's lavish support for Buddhism
        - dispatch officials to local regions
        - ten injunctions of Wang Kon are ignored and other national scale buddhist things
    - established Kukchagam 992, a public confucian college
    - Songjong issued law: those who used to be slaves should be returned to masters
    - restored aristocratic families that were purged during Kwangjong 
    - songjong did not abolish civil service exam; took pressure off of people who were smart but couldnt become govt official due to born status
        - high ranking official discontent; their children had to study!
        - Songjong, Choe Sung ro, to assuage the officials: umso (protected appointment system)
    - umso
        - straight up gave governmental positions to high ranking official's children
        - umso rights given to like rank 5ish officials
        - rank 5 is approximately GS 5 in US (?)
        - if father is govt official, you are automatically govt official
        - 15 year olds, even 10 year olds, got the job
        - more than 60% of high ranking officials through umso
        - Koryo expanded this later, even nephews could pass with no exam
        - to be really high ranking officials, they had to demonstrate their ability, but they received these still very high government positions
        - civil service exam was pretty difficult to pass, mid 20s pass at best
            - 10 years disparity
        - many thus enjoyed power from generation and generation in koryo
        - why did songjong do this? maybe he had a personal grudge against Kwangjong or something
        - songjong was avid follower of confucianism
            - declared he would rule with filial piety, loyalty (which are very important parts of Confucianism)
        - based on birth, not merit -- similar to bone rank system
        - aristocrats thus continued to flourish throughout Koryo
- international trades
    - unlike joson, Koryo was pretty open country
    - encouraged international trade
    - port pyongnando at mouth of river leading to Kaesong
        - the center of international trade for Koryo
        - pyongnando always full of merchants who came from many diff countries
        - Kaesong also full of merchants
        - koryo traded with Song dynasty most often
    - Chinese song (960-1279)
        - came from china peninsula area across from KP
    - also jurchen, khitan people
    - arabian merchants, "corea" -> "korea", how the rest of the world knew KP
    - exchanged gold, silver, paper, hemp cloths exported by Koryo
    - also Koryo ginseng one of most famous exports
- Private Confucian academy
    - civil service exam good conduit for ambitious students to become officials
    - confucianism thus became really important
    - choe chung (984-1068), a scholar
        - in 1055 established private school near Kaesong, first time in history of korea
        - taught confucian classics and writing
        - expensive schools, commoners couldnt really go to these
    - students studied hard, even during summer, rented buddhist temple near capital and had summer intensive courses
    - alumni (people who passed service exams) taught courses
    - other confucian scholars followed Choe Chung's example and built other schools
        - 12 private confucian academies
        - closed in 1391!
    - the one school at the time was crap
    - helped each other within the network. choe chung school was the best
    - boom for confucian education
    - decline due to mongol invasion
    - govt tried to revive them but eventually had to close, 1391 right before Koryo collapse

    - koryo had a lot of money, mansions, built luxurious lives
    - always had horses, guards, wore silk from China (no technique in korea to make silk)
- aristocratic buddhism
    - most koryo aristocrats followed buddhism
    - many great buddhist works of art: aristocrats donated money to artists to make sculptures, art for rituals
    - about 160 paintings still survive! (most in japan because colonization)
    - water-moon avalokitesvara (really a copy of taitoku-ji)
        - these kinds of paintings not found in china, silla, choson
        - discrepancy in size of primary, secondary figures, reflected commoners aristocrats difference in power at the time
        - but why does painted this way? just a unique style of koryo painting
    - illustrated manuscripts of the lotus sutra
        - painted in gold, display room really small in the Met
        - super delicate, story of burning house and 3 carts (?)
- koryo the buddhist country
    - wang kon's ten injunctions, aristocrats greatly supported buddhism financially and politically

    - royal and aristocratic family members becaue monks and nuns
        - such as wang kon's wives, etc
    - koryo high ranking monks close to high ranking royal family members
    - relationship between buddhism and confucianism great, just like silla
    - choe sung ro: "confucianism is an instrument to govern the country while buddhism is a doctrine for personal salvation"
    - choson confucian scholars believed confucianism is the only cocmplete way of life
        - argued that everything abt human life should be regulated by confucianism
        - koryo scholars didnt believe this; confucianism is just a tool for development
    - many confucianist scholars called themselves "kosa", (lay practitioner of Buddhism)
    - Yun On-i (1090-1149) - diamond Kosa
    - Yi Kyu bo (1168-1241) - white cloud kosa

        - in 1010, koryo carved wood blocks for the entire buddhist canon, relying on spiritual power of buddhism, the khitan army actually did retreat
        - in 1019, kang kam-chan defeated invading army in Kwiju Teach'op(sweeping victory at Kwiju) one of the three biggest victories along with the other one in Koguryo
        - Kang Kam chan actually a civil dude
    - jurchen also some small scale wars, but no real big war
        - attacked jin dynasty, occupied northern half of chinese mainland (1115-1234)
        - when koryo attacked jurchcen ni 1107 above koryo territory, there were special forces called Hangma Kun (demon subduing army)
            - consisting of buddhist monks 
            - but were they actual buddhist monks?
            - similar to japanese sohei (warrior monks)

        - Kim Pu-sik, belonged to kaesong faction, he was a civil official btw
    - tensions, insecurities of the koryo aristocracy
- how did koryo kings use buddhism/confucianism/religion to legitimize their authority?
    - this will be an exam question
    - filial piety, loyalty of confucianism - be respectful to parents - also makes you respectful to officials
    - commoners devout followers of buddhism -- perhaps to ease their discontent
